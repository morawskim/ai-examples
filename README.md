## resnet101-image-labels

The **resnet101-image-labels** project demonstrates using the **ResNet-101** model for image classification tasks.
The code uses a pre-trained version of ResNet-101 from the PyTorch library.
The goal of the code is to classify input images into one of the **1,000 ImageNet categories**.
