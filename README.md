A collection of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) code examples demonstrating various algorithms and techniques.
This repository aims to provide practical, easy-to-understand examples.

## resnet101-image-labels

The **resnet101-image-labels** project demonstrates using the **ResNet-101** model for image classification tasks.
The code uses a pre-trained version of ResNet-101 from the PyTorch library.
The goal of the code is to classify input images into one of the **1,000 ImageNet categories**.

## pytorch-dataset

The **pytorch-dataset** project contains an example of how to create a custom dataset in PyTorch by subclassing the Dataset class (torch.utils.data.Dataset).
Custom datasets are essential when working with data that isn't readily available through standard libraries or requires specific preprocessing steps.

We use [Food101 dataset](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/datasets_extra/food-101/).
Food101 is popular computer vision benchmark as it contains 1000 images of 101 different kinds of foods.
